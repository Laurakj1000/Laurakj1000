Hi, I'm Laura K. Jones 👋

Senior Editor & AI Content Auditor | Linguistic Specialist
I am a Senior Editor and Quality Reviewer with over 25 years of experience in high-standard journalism, including tenures at The Times, The Guardian, and The Sunday Telegraph. I apply a veteran's editorial eye to ensure AI-generated content is accurate, logical, and culturally resonant.
